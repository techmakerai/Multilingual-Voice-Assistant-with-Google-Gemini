Before you can run this code on your computer, you will need to install the following packages on your computer to run this code: 

```console
pip install speechrecognition openai gTTS pyaudio pygame
```
If you have Python 3.12 or newer, also install the "setuptools" package,    

```console
pip install setuptools
```
In addition, you must set the API key from OpenAI as a system environment variable. If you rather want to use your API key in the Python program, then add it as, 

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="this is your API key")
```
You may need to create a Python virtual environment first.
